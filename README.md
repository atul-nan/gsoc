# Cypherock Wallet + Google Summer of Code, 2024
Welcome to the main resource for all things related to Cypherock Wallet's participation in Google Summer of Code, 2024. We're thrilled to join as a mentoring organization, aiming to foster innovation and education in the open-source community through collaboration on exciting [projects](2024/README.md) 

## What is Google Summer of Code?

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is an internationally recognized program that encourages student involvement in open-source development. Over the summer, students collaborate with organizations to complete projects that contribute meaningfully to the open-source ecosystem.

The program provides a stipend to students, enabling them to dedicate their time to work on their projects. Since 2023, GSoC has expanded its eligibility to include all newcomers to open source aged 18 and above, broadening the scope of participation.
